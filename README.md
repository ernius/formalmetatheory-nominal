# Alpha-Structural Induction and Recursion for the Lambda Calculus in Constructive Type Theory

We formulate principles of induction and recursion for a variant of lambda calculus with bound names where alpha-conversion is based upon name swapping as in nominal abstract syntax. The principles allow to work modulo alpha-conversion and apply the Barendregt variable convention. We derive them all from the simple structural induction principle and apply them to get some fundamental meta-theoretical results, such as the substitution lemma for alpha-conversion and the result of substitution composition. The whole work is implemented in Agda, and is browsable [here](http://ernius.github.io/formalmetatheory-nominal/html/index.html).
